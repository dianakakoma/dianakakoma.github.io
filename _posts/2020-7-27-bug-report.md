## Welcome to the bug_report_be wiki!<br>
Bug report allows a user of your software to create an account, login, create a bug report or feature request, and then submit it to you with a screenshot and relevant URL.

**User Story**<br>
As a user, I want to be able to submit bug reports or feature requests easily and quickly. 
<br>
<br>
**Road Map**<br>
This MVC/CRUD application is going to make it easier for end-users to make actionable bug reports by easily incorporating the URL with the issue as well as allowing the user to include a screenshot of the issue. 
<br>
In addition to bug reports, this application will allow users to make feature requests while using the software. Again the URL will be captured and the user can upload a photo that supports their request.

Today I started the Rails backend with the PostgreSQL database. I also created the models and controllers and seeded the database. 
This week's plan is to complete the backend by building out the MVC structure, test routes, controllers and views with Insomnia, and create the authentication functionality. 
Next week I will build the front end and the week after that I'll polish off the front-end with a Bootstrap theme. 

*Below is an image of the database design:*
