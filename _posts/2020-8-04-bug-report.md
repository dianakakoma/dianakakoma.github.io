**Front-end here I come!**
Good morning, 
There has been much progress on the bug report. Last week I completed the CRUD actions, authentications (with the JWT gem) and validations for the back-end. 
Writing tests turned out to be much more of a challenge than I anticipated, so instead of delaying producion while I implement RSpec or Mini-test, I am relying on what is being rendered by in Insomnia. 
This week I will work on installing the Axios library to connect the back-end to the soon-to-be front end and setting up the Vue.js front-end. The first priorities of the front-end will be the index and create actions because they must be fully functional by Thursday, August 6th.
