**Testing Rails applications with RSpec**
<br>
I studied VS Code so that I could take Udemy's <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/testing-ruby-with-rspec/"> Testing Ruby with RSpec: The Complete Guide<a/>. Now I cannot imagine going back developing in Sublime. 
That being said, I got through enough of the RSpec class to write unit tests for Bug Report 1.2.
Another source I found very helpful for actually writing the tests was Jlspursfan's <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/rspec-tests-for-beginners-a798c8bf6bac"> RSpec Tests for Beginners </a>
