  <h2> My Coding Journey</h2>
          
            <h4 style="font-family:Times">I have been passionate about code since I discovered the backend of my Wordpress site. At the time my only interest was in making small adjustments to a pre-built theme, but I soon found myself staying up really late and doing much more.
Since then I have logged countless hours learning on my own, but I recently completed the Actualize Coding Bootcamp in Chicago. The bootcamp experience gave me a solid understanding of the full development cycle, an opportunity to code with others on a common goal, and a great foundation for learning any tools and languages as the need arises.
I have a background in the law as well as client services, so I can apply my communication skills to any project, but my experience also includes Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, Vue.js, HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL, Git, Testing, Pair-Programming, Object-Oriented Programming, APIs and Bootstrap.
